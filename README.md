# ytmusic-scripts
Collection of Python scripts for controlling YouTube music.

## Installation

This project utilizes [`ytmusicapi`](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi), and, therefore, 
requires the same installation procedures as it.

1. Please install `ytmusicapi`, either through `pip install ytmusicapi`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, 
or through installing this package.

2. After successfully installing `ytmusicapi`, please visit and follow instructions on the
[`ytmusicapi` setup page](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup/oauth.html).

3. Run your desired script in the same directory as your `oauth.json`. If you do not have an
`oauth.json` file, revisit step 2.
